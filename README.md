Basic Work

My calculator does all things that are described in Language note. Also, it follows the calculator grammar. I have a test file and its output 

In this homework, I have three files in total
1)scan.rb 		scan input file and transfer it to Tokens
2)clac.rb		get the tokens and do the calculation
3)hw8.txt 		this is a test file which contains the input that user gives and output the calculator returns

eg: input: 		1+1
	  output: 	2


Extra work
1) Print meaningful message after assignment and clear statements.
2) Extend the language by allowing empty lines (statements) in the input, allowing multiple statements on an input line separated by semicolons, or allowing unary minus operators
3) I added a function called log to give the log of the expressions by using the Ruby math library.
4) When it reads an invalid token like # or ' ', it will skip this unvalid line, print the meaningful message and continue to read next line.
